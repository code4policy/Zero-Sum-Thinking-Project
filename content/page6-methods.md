Purpose of This Page
This page explains how the research measures zero-sum thinking and how the results presented on this website are produced. It is intended to support transparency, informed interpretation, and responsible use of the findings.

Research Design
The study “Zero-Sum Thinking and the Roots of U.S. Political Differences” uses a large-scale survey-based research design to examine how beliefs about gains and losses shape political attitudes in the United States.
________________________________________
Survey Data
The analysis is based on a nationally large survey sample comprising more than 20,000 respondents. The survey was designed to capture beliefs, attitudes, and background characteristics across a wide range of social, economic, and political topics.
In the original study, standard survey weighting procedures are applied to improve representativeness relative to the U.S. adult population.

Measurement of Zero-Sum Thinking
Zero-sum thinking is measured using multiple survey questions that ask respondents to indicate their level of agreement with statements about gains and losses across different contexts. These questions are framed in general terms and do not require respondents to endorse specific political parties or policies.
The survey items cover several domains, including:
•   relations between social or ethnic groups,
•   economic outcomes across income groups,
•   international trade,
•   competition between citizens and non-citizens.

Index Construction
Responses to the zero-sum survey items are combined into a composite zero-sum thinking index. The index is constructed using standard survey research practices:
•   responses are coded in a consistent direction,
•   multiple items are aggregated to capture overall orientation,
•   the resulting index is normalized for interpretability.
Higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to view one group’s gains as coming at the expense of others, while lower scores indicate greater openness to the possibility of shared gains.

Analytical Methods
The study relies on descriptive analysis and regression-based methods to examine:
•   how zero-sum thinking varies across demographic, social, and political groups,
•   how it is associated with attitudes toward redistribution, immigration, trade, and other policy areas,
•   how it relates to political polarization beyond standard explanations based on partisanship or material interests.

Interpretation and Limits
The findings are descriptive and associational, not causal. The study does not claim that zero-sum thinking directly causes specific political outcomes.

Transparency and Replicability
The original publication provides detailed documentation of survey questions, index construction, and analytical procedures in its appendices and supplementary materials. These materials allow other researchers to evaluate, replicate, or extend the analysis.
