Zero-Sum Thinking and U.S. Political Differences
Subtitle (H2)
An interactive explainer, data dashboard, and self-assessment
________________________________________
The Concept in Short
Zero-sum thinking is the belief that gains for one group necessarily come at the expense of others. This belief shapes how people interpret economic change, social groups, and public policy.
________________________________________
Purpose
This website translates the empirical findings of the publication “Zero-Sum Thinking and the Roots of U.S. Political Differences” by Sahil Chinoy, Nathan Nunn, Sandra Sequeira, Stefanie Stantcheva into an interactive, public-facing educational platform. It combines conceptual explanation, empirical visualization, and self-assessment, while maintaining academic rigor, transparency, and ethical safeguards.

Why Zero-Sum Thinking 
Beliefs about gains and losses unavoidably play a central role in social and political life. Zero-sum thinking shapes how people interpret conflict and cooperation, evaluate political leaders, respond to election outcomes, and assess policies related to redistribution, immigration, trade, and social inclusion. It helps explain why similar economic or social changes can generate cooperation and trust in some settings, but fear, polarization, or conflict in others.
Why This Study
The research used draws on a large-scale, carefully designed survey study by established scholars in political economy and public economics. By systematically measuring zero-sum thinking and linking it to political attitudes, the study provides one of the most comprehensive empirical frameworks to date for understanding how underlying beliefs about gains and losses contribute to political disagreement, policy resistance, and broader patterns of social cohesion and conflict.
