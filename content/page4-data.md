PAGE 4 — EXPLORE THE DATA
What You Are Seeing
This page presents aggregated results from the survey study on zero-sum thinking. The charts and maps summarize patterns across groups and places; they do not display individual responses.
The purpose of this page is to help users explore how zero-sum thinking varies across the population and how it relates to different social and political attitudes.
________________________________________
How to Read the Charts
Each chart shows how zero-sum thinking scores are distributed or how average scores differ across groups or locations.
As a reminder:
Higher scores mean people are more likely to see one group’s gains as another group’s losses, while lower scores mean people are more open to the idea that different groups can gain at the same time.

Sections on This Page
You can explore the data in several ways:
Overall Patterns
These charts show the overall distribution of zero-sum thinking scores across the survey sample.
Groups and Differences
These charts compare average scores across groups, such as education levels, income categories, or other demographic characteristics. Group averages reflect patterns, not individual beliefs.
Geography
Maps display average zero-sum thinking scores by geographic area. Geographic patterns reflect aggregated responses and may be influenced by many social, economic, and historical factors.
Relationships with Attitudes
Some charts show how zero-sum thinking is related to attitudes on selected policy issues. These relationships indicate associations, not causes.

Important Notes on Interpretation
•	Differences shown here are statistical patterns, not judgments about individuals or groups.
•	A higher or lower average score does not imply that everyone in a group thinks the same way.
•	Associations shown in the charts do not mean that one belief causes another.
These results should be read as descriptive evidence that helps illuminate broader patterns of thinking.
