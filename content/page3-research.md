Purpose of the Study
The study “Zero-Sum Thinking and the Roots of U.S. Political Differences” investigates how beliefs about gains and losses shape political attitudes in the United States. Rather than focusing only on material interests or partisan identities, the research examines a deeper cognitive framework: whether individuals tend to see social and economic outcomes as zero-sum or as allowing for shared gains.
The central claim is that zero-sum thinking is a measurable mindset that helps explain persistent political disagreement across a wide range of policy areas.

How Zero-Sum Thinking Is Measured
The study measures zero-sum thinking using survey questions designed to capture respondents’ beliefs about whether gains for one group come at the expense of others.
Respondents are asked to indicate their level of agreement with statements expressing zero-sum views across different social and economic domains. Higher agreement with these statements indicates a stronger zero-sum orientation.

Domains Covered
Zero-sum thinking is measured across multiple domains, including:
•   Ethnic and social groups
Beliefs about whether gains for one group imply losses for others.
•   International trade
Beliefs about whether economic gains from trade are necessarily offset by losses elsewhere.
•   Income and economic groups
Beliefs about whether increases in wealth for some groups require others to become worse off.
•   Citizens and non-citizens
Beliefs about competition over economic opportunities and resources.
Measuring multiple domains allowed the researchers to assess whether zero-sum thinking reflects a general mindset rather than issue-specific opinions.

From Survey Responses to an Index
Individual responses are combined into a standardized zero-sum thinking index, typically scaled from low to high values. Higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to view social and economic outcomes as zero-sum.
The index construction follows standard practices in survey research, ensuring internal consistency and comparability across respondents.
Details on question wording, scaling, and validation are provided in the original paper and its supplementary materials.

How to Interpret the Zero-Sum Thinking Index
The zero-sum thinking index is scaled so that higher values indicate a stronger tendency to view social and economic outcomes as zero-sum, meaning that gains for one group are perceived as coming at the expense of others. Lower values indicate a weaker zero-sum orientation and a greater openness to the possibility of shared gains.
