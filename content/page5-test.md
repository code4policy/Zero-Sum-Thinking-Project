5. Take the Zero‑Sum Thinking Test (Ordinary User and Others)
PAGE 5 — TAKE THE ZERO-SUM THINKING TEST
What This Test Is
This short questionnaire is adapted from survey questions used in the research on zero-sum thinking. It asks about how people view gains and losses in different situations.
The test is designed to help you understand how your responses compare with overall patterns observed in the study.
________________________________________
Before You Begin
•	There are a small number of statements.
•	There are no right or wrong answers.
•	Your responses are not stored and are processed only to calculate your score.
Please answer based on how you generally think, not how you think you “should” answer.
________________________________________
After You See Your Score
Your result is summarized using the zero-sum thinking index.
As a reminder:
Higher scores mean people are more likely to see one group’s gains as another group’s losses, while lower scores mean people are more open to the idea that different groups can gain at the same time.
Your score reflects tendencies, not fixed traits, and it may vary across contexts or over time.
________________________________________
How to Read Your Result
•	The score shows where your responses fall relative to the overall distribution reported in the study.
•	Being higher or lower on the scale does not indicate that a view is right or wrong.
•	People with similar scores may still disagree strongly on specific policies or issues.
This tool is meant to encourage reflection, not to label individuals.

Important Notes
•	This test does not diagnose beliefs, values, or political identity.
•	It does not predict behavior or voting.
•	It is intended for educational use only.
