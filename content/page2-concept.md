2. What is Zero‑Sum Thinking? (For Ordinary user principally but also for researchers and policy makers)
PAGE 2 — WHAT IS ZERO-SUM THINKING? 
The Idea
Zero-sum thinking is the belief that gains for one person or group must come at the expense of others. In other words, it assumes that there is a fixed amount to be shared, and that if someone gains more, someone else must lose.
This way of thinking is common in everyday discussions about the economy, politics, and social change.

Zero-Sum Thinking vs. Shared Gains
Not all situations involve unavoidable trade-offs. In many cases, economic growth, cooperation, or new policies can allow multiple groups to benefit at the same time.
•	Zero-sum thinking views outcomes as a fixed pie: one group’s gain implies another group’s loss.
•	Shared-gains (or positive-sum) thinking allows for the possibility that the overall pie can grow, so that more than one group can benefit.
People may apply one or the other way of thinking depending on the issue, the context, or their personal experiences.

A Simple Example: The Pie/ Pizza
Imagine a pie shared by two groups.
•	In zero-sum thinking, the size of the pie never changes.
If one group gets a larger slice, the other group must get a smaller one.
•	In shared-gains (positive-sum) thinking, the pie itself can grow.
Both groups can end up with larger slices, even if the shares are not equal.
This example shows why zero-sum thinking focuses on competition over fixed resources, while other perspectives allow for cooperation, growth, or mutual benefit.

Common Examples
Zero-sum thinking often appears in debates about:
•	Jobs: If one group gets more jobs, others must lose out.
•	Trade: If one country benefits from trade, another country must be harmed.
•	Immigration: Gains for immigrants reduce opportunities for citizens.
•	Income and wealth: If some people become richer, others must become poorer.
These beliefs shape how people interpret social and economic change, even when the actual outcomes may be more complex.

Why This Way of Thinking Matters
How people understand gains and losses affects how they view social groups, political competition, and public policy. Zero-sum thinking can increase feelings of threat, competition, or unfairness between groups, while other perspectives may encourage cooperation or compromise.
Understanding this mindset helps explain why people can react very differently to the same policies, events, or economic trends.

What Next 
Now you either take the test or dive deeper into the research and see how researchers study and measure zero-sum thinking using survey questions. 
To study zero-sum thinking, researchers have asked people a small number of carefully designed questions about gains and losses in different situations. The answers are combined into a single zero-sum thinking index, which summarizes how strongly a person tends to see outcomes as zero-sum: Higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to believe a group’s gain comes at the expense of another, while lower scores indicate greater openness to the possibility of shared gains. In other words, higher score reflects a stronger “one wins, one loses” view; lower score reflects a stronger ‘both can benefit’ view.
