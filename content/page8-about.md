PAGE 9 — ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Project
This website was created as an educational project to make academic research on zero-sum thinking accessible to a broader audience. It presents a non-partisan, public-facing summary of published research, combining conceptual explanation, data visualization, and a self-assessment tool.
The site does not conduct original research or collect new data. Its purpose is to support learning, policy discussion, and informed reflection on how beliefs about gains and losses relate to political attitudes and social outcomes.

The Website Project
This website was developed as part of the Programming and Data for Policy Makers course at the Harvard Kennedy School
(https://www.hks.harvard.edu/courses/programming-and-data-policymakers).
The course introduces students to computational thinking, data analysis, and digital tools for policy analysis and public communication. This project applies those skills to the responsible translation of academic research into an interactive, public-facing format.
