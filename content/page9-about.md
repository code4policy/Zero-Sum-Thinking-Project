PAGE 9 — ABOUT THE PROJECT
About This Website
This website was created as an educational project to make academic research on zero-sum thinking accessible to a broader audience. It presents a non-partisan, public-facing summary of published research, combining conceptual explanation, data visualization, and a self-assessment tool.
The site does not conduct original research or collect new data. Its purpose is to support learning, policy discussion, and informed reflection on how beliefs about gains and losses relate to political attitudes and social outcomes.

About the Research
The content presented on this website is based on the study “Zero-Sum Thinking and the Roots of U.S. Political Differences.” The study examines how beliefs about gains and losses—rather than policy positions or partisan identities alone—help explain political disagreement and polarization in the United States.
The research relies on large-scale survey data and established methods in political economy and public economics. Full methodological details, survey instruments, and replication materials are available in the original publication and its supplementary materials.

About the Website Project
This website was developed as part of the Programming and Data for Policy Makers course at the Harvard Kennedy School
(https://www.hks.harvard.edu/courses/programming-and-data-policymakers).
The course introduces students to computational thinking, data analysis, and digital tools for policy analysis and public communication. This project applies those skills to the responsible translation of academic research into an interactive, public-facing format.
